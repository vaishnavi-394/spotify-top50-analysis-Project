## üìÇ Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using SQL. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced). The primary goals of the project are to practice Basic SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

## üìä **Project Steps**
1. üìå **Dataset Exploration**
Before writing SQL queries, first explore the dataset to understand key attributes:

üéµ Song ‚Äì track name

üë§ Artist ‚Äì performer of the track

üóì Release_date ‚Äì when the track was released

üìä Streams & Popularity ‚Äì track‚Äôs performance metrics

‚è± Duration_ms ‚Äì track length in milliseconds

üîñ Album_type & is_explicit ‚Äì content categorization

This step helps identify trends & decide which questions to answer.

**Table Creation & Data Import
Create table spotify_streaming_top_50_usa in MySQL

Import cleaned dataset ("C:\Users\Shreya\OneDrive\Desktop\DATA ANALYTICS\SQL FOLDER\PROJECTS\spotify-streaming-top-50-usa.csv")**

3. üõ† **DataSet Schema**:  
```sql
CREATE TABLE spotify_streaming_top_50_usa (
    track_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    position INT,
    song VARCHAR(200),
    artist VARCHAR(150),
    streams BIGINT,
    url VARCHAR(300),
    popularity INT,
    duration_ms INT,
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    release_date DATE,
    is_explicit BOOLEAN
);

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
 1.Dataset Size & Unique Counts
 2.Release Dates Overview**
 3. Distribution by Album Type & Explicit 
 4.Popularity Statistics
 5.Text & Title Analysis
 6.Songs Released per Year
 7.Top 5 most popular songs

Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

Easy Queries
Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.


Medium Queries
More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.

Advanced Queries
Nested subqueries

üì¶ *Helps explore track categorization.*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT album_type
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa;
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Get the total number of tracks released after 2020**

üïí *Focus on modern releases.*

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'TOTAL TRACKS'
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE YEAR(release_date) >= 2020;
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Find all tracks that belong to the album type 'single'**

üé∂ *Show tracks released as singles.*

```sql
SELECT song, artist, album_type
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE album_type = 'single';
```

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Count the total number of tracks by each artist**

üë§ *Identify most prolific artists.*

```sql
SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS 'TOTAL TRACKS'
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
GROUP BY artist;
```

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ List tracks with above average popularity**

‚≠ê *Find tracks that performed better than dataset average.*

```sql
SELECT song, popularity
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE popularity > (
  SELECT AVG(popularity)
  FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
);
```

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ List all tracks that have the same artist as 'Lavender Haze'**

üîó *Subquery to find related tracks by the same artist.*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT song, artist
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE artist IN (
  SELECT artist
  FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
  WHERE song = 'Lavender Haze'
);
```

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Find tracks with longest and shortest duration (in minutes)**

‚è± *Showcase duration extremes in the dataset.*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT song, CONCAT(ROUND(duration_ms / 60000, 2), ' mins') AS duration_minutes
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE duration_ms = (SELECT MAX(duration_ms) FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa)
   OR duration_ms = (SELECT MIN(duration_ms) FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa);
```

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Find tracks whose album\_type matches the most popular track's album\_type**

üìå *Use subquery to filter by album type of the top track.*

```sql
SELECT song, album_type, popularity
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE album_type = (
  SELECT album_type
  FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 1
);
```

---

### **üîü Artists with longer-than-average tracks (albums after 2020)**

üöÄ *Explore newer music trends based on track length.*

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT song, artist
FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
WHERE duration_ms > (
  SELECT AVG(duration_ms)
  FROM spotify_streaming_top_50_usa
  WHERE release_date >= '2020-01-01'
);
```
